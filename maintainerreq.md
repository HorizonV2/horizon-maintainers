# To become an official maintainer for HorizonDroid:

**Before you apply to add your device into our list of official devices, you should know a few things:**

1. You **MUST** own the device. Blind and untested builds aren't allowed. Unified, and devices with minimal hardware changes are also allowed to be maintained.

2. You must have basic git (cherry-pick, squash, etc) knowledge.

3. Your trees should be **clean** and should have **proper authorships** and commit names.

4. Your device sources **MUST** be open source for us.

5. You **MUST** be on SELinux enforcing.

6. Prebuilt kernels are only allowed **if your device does not have proper kernel sources**., You **MUSTN'T** ship a prebuilt kernel if you have working kernel sources available just because you save 5 minutes of build time.

7. You should have some basic knowledge of reading logcats and managing most device releated errors/bugs.

8. You must not maintain more than 3 ROMs including HorizonDroid (applies for both official and unofficial) and also XDA threads are recommended but not mandatory.

9. You should release an unofficial build and **MUST** attach a link in the maintainership form.
